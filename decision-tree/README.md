# Decision Tree

This contains a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) and a random [decision forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest).

## Decision Tree
The decision tree is trained by splitting a training set until the impurity is minimized.

## Decision Forest
The forest is a collection of decision trees trained using random subsets of the original training set.

## Example
A simple classification example using 2D points is in the [docs](https://github.com/branchvincent/cv-tools/blob/master/decision-tree/doc).
