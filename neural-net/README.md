# Neural Network

This contains a custom [neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) implementation and MATLAB's implementation.

## Example
Simple examples of using a neural net as a [universal function approximator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) and of training a net for a 2D classification problem is in the [docs](https://github.com/branchvincent/cv-tools/blob/master/neural-net/doc).
