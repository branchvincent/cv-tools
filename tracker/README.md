# Tracker

This contains code to compute "good" trackable features for the [Lucas-Kanade tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Kanade_method).  

## Example
A simple example using a piano player's hands is in the [docs](https://github.com/branchvincent/cv-tools/blob/master/tracker/doc).
